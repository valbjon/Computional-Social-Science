# CSS19

Research indicates that there is gender bias in Wikipedia, which should be tackled since Wikipedia is one of the major sources
of information on the web. We study this bias by looking at the articles about persons that stayed inside Wikipedia but were 
challenged before they could stay. We look at the percentage of male/female pages that got nominated for deletion but then 
didn't get deleted on a year by year basis as well as cumulative.
